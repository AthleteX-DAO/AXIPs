Note that a AXIP number will be assigned by an editor.
When opening a pull request to submit your UMIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, umip-draft_title_abbrev.md.

## Summary (2-5 sentences)
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the issue.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical to change the AthleteX protocol.
Please describe the outcome or improvement to the existing process that you would like to see.

## Technical Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of the proposed solution for the issue raised.
If a suggestion is proposed, provide sufficient details so that an implementation would be possible (Proof of Concepts are acceptable).
Please specify if you would like to suggest new APTs, a modification to the athletex contracts or the exchange itself

## Rationale
The rationale should flesh out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made, as well as any alternative designs that were considered.

## Implementation
An implementation must be completed before any AXIP proceeds to full deployment.

## Security considerations
All AXIPs must include a discussion of the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change as well as proposed mitigations.
An AXIP cannot proceed to “Implemented” status without a sufficient security review from the core team.
